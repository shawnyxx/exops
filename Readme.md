# Ecxo Games Orphaned Proprietary Softwares Suite

## What is it and what can you do with it?
EXOPS is a public repository made to show some of our most useful programs that saved us a lot of time.

From research project, anti-cheating studies, game feature implementation project to video games bots, ecxo games 
has been busy trying to find reason to gain time using simple and advanced robotized productivity solutions.

Cheating is a subject most people are angry about in the gaming industry, and this is for both gamer side and developer side.

Most of our projects presented here are just task bots, macros, failed ai training attempts and a couple of successful productivity 
gaining application.





## Our projects

### Media Diddy

#### An easy to use spotify downloader - By [@Shawnyxx](https://github.com/shawnyxx)

But what is it for?
I am of course paying for the music I use publicaly, and I am a paying [deezer](https://www.deezer.com/) customer. But honestly, I loved apple music and I wont pay for both. What's the link with spotify, well spotify is one of the weak cousin of the music streaming industry. They are very easy to scrap since with fame comes hate, and hate led them to multiple paying and non-paying customers working together to put together a scrapper tool that allows anyone to download their music with the full metadata, lyrics, and even album covers. The name of the package is called [spot-dl](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader).

Using their simple powershell command, you are able to download a whole playlist, album, or an artist's whole music discography. I am not pushing forward to do that, nor ecxo games is, therefore the making process of this software is all for research purposes to prevent scrappers from reaching the content the community will post on our gaming platform.

### Fishbot

#### Job automation using Computer Vision on the roblox game Bloxburg - By [@Shawnyxx](https://github.com/shawnyxx)

This project was real fun to do and I cannot indulge people saying that this is hacking. I can of course say that it's the intended way doing things but this is not hacking and since I have spent over 70 hours developing this, I cannot really say that I made profit of it, since I would've made over 70 Millions in the game if I would've worked it like a human.

If you don't know what Bloxburg is, it's one of the most played game of the Metaverse-Like video game platform [Roblox](https://corp.roblox.com/).

[SecretiveShell](https://github.com/SecretiveShell) is a guy that also did bot the same way as me, except that I made a GUI. Here is his [project](https://github.com/SecretiveShell/bloxburg-auto-fish)

You can check out Bloxburg on Roblox [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/185655149/Welcome-to-Bloxburg)
