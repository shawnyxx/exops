# Media Diddy Suite

## A suite of easy-to-use media downloading softwares - By [@Shawnyxx](https://github.com/shawnyxx)

This software suite started as a simple media downloader for spotify but recently had a newborn brother coming into its family. Media Diddy now has two softwares attached to its name.

### **Youtube Diddy:**

Youtube Diddy is, as its name suggest, a youtube downloader. It allows you to save youtube videos in any format. Easy to use, it requires a link, and an optionnal file name.

### **Spotify Diddy:**

Spotify Diddy is pretty similar to Youtube Diddy, it allows you to save spotify songs to your computer but also to organize your music library into a very organized local music library.

Coming with multiple sorting options, interchangeable lyrics source, cover art support, and much more, Spotify Diddy, bundled with spotdl, allows you to download any song/playlists you want and let the software organize it for you.

# Fishbot

### Job automation using Computer Vision on the roblox game Bloxburg - By [@Shawnyxx](https://github.com/shawnyxx)

This project was real fun to do and I cannot indulge people saying that this is hacking. I can of course say that it's the intended way doing things but this is not hacking and since I have spent over 70 hours developing this, I cannot really say that I made profit of it, since I would've made over 70 Millions in the game if I would've worked it like a human.

If you don't know what Bloxburg is, it's one of the most played game of the Metaverse-Like video game platform [Roblox](https://corp.roblox.com/).

[SecretiveShell](https://github.com/SecretiveShell) is a guy that also did bot the same way as me, except that I made a GUI. Here is his [project](https://github.com/SecretiveShell/bloxburg-auto-fish)

You can check out Bloxburg on Roblox [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/185655149/Welcome-to-Bloxburg)
